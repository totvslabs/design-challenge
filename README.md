# TOTVS Labs Design Challenge
Many people want to leave popular social networks but are concerned leaving would mean no longer being notified about local events. Imagine an experience which allowed users to create, share, attend, or be notified about certain events. Keep in mind that people may have different tastes or some events may not be of interest to them, and that the creator may be a business.

Design a maximum of 2-4 screens for web (desktop) application, providing as much background thinking as you can.

```
Important: You can assume you have an AI Platform that will help you to facilitate some workflows, 
make smart recommendations, etc.
```

# Event Creator or Event Attendee?
You can decide whether you would like to design the event creator or event attendee experience and design the ideal workflow, in particular demonstrating your understanding of what information is important for these events, and how people might find them

### Important characteristics of an event:
* Where is it?
* How much does it cost?
* What time should I leave to arrive on time?
* What's the best way to get there?
* What should I know prior to the event?

# Features

The application could include:
* Taste profiles
* Searching for events
* Smart recommendation
* Friends invitation for events
* Useful notifications
* Events reminders
* Smart check-in to events (digital badges)

# Priorities
* Good usability
* Appropriate aesthetics for the demographic, tone, web app paradigms, etc
* Insight into your process, including any sketches, brainstorms, notes, wireframes, and assumptions on the product.
